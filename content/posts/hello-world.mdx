Welcome to my new blog. I've been meaning to write more for a while now, and finally got around to setting this up.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Building products** - Lessons learned from building software at startups and larger companies
- **Startups** - Thoughts on entrepreneurship and the startup journey
- **Technology** - Interesting tech trends and developments

## Why write?

Writing helps me think more clearly. It forces me to organize my thoughts and often reveals gaps in my understanding. Plus, it's a way to share what I've learned with others who might find it useful.

Stay tuned for more posts soon.
