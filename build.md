Im rebuilding this personal site into a full featured blog. Using nextJS, tailwind, mdx

The end goal is something I can use for posting thoughts, technical deep dives and mini experimetns.

Redesign the site to support nice typography (I like the tailwindcss typography package, redesigning the frontend page. Then add a writing section with a "hello world" blog post for mdx.
